# DRAFT

> For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating [Prince Edward Island](https://www.google.ca/maps/@46.4033276,-62.9856972,8.32z) in a sea kayak. There are roughly around 300 nautical miles if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.

A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:

-   [William Arthur "Bill" Reddin and dog Bozo (1934-1935), canoe, counter-clockwise](https://islandvoices.ca/islandora/object/ivoices%3A318)
-   [Wendy Killoran (May-June 2005), 15 days, clockwise](https://glska.com/around-p-e-i-by-kayak/)
-   [Joseph Simmonds, teen, sea kayak (August 2016), 12 days, counter-clockwise](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-kayak-1.3729504)
-   [Annette Boerlage, sea kayak, (TODO)](https://fourfeetonadventure.com/)
-   [Douglas Russell and Colin Hudson, SUP (June 2020), 12 days, clockwise](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/two-veterans-become-first-to-paddleboard-around-p-e-i-for-injured-soldiers-1.5978679)

The purpose of the trip is to challenge oneself, enjoy and explore. Speed of travel is secondary to exploring and I have set aside up to a month for doing this trip.

First step was to figure out when. I think that for PEI the months of June and July are the best for a multi-day paddle. The waters start warming up, there are no bugs, it is not excessively warm which means that there is so no significant weather either, and the daylight time is the longest.

The next step was to see which way to proceed: clockwise or counter-clockwise. This took some time discussing with friends and fellow kayakers, and also looking at what other paddlers have done. Around PEI the wind is usually the most important factor, followed by some currents. The strongest currents are in the strait around the Trans-Canada Highway bridge. Picking up neap tides while traversing this area would make the paddling easier.

As a side-note, at the time of writing this, the bridge toll is [$50.25](https://www.confederationbridge.com/tolls-fees) per car.

To get a feel for the winds I went to the [Windy](https://www.windy.com) website and looked for historical data on the winds around PEI. The prevailing winds during summer are the south-westerlies. The north shore would then be mostly in the lee. The way the island is positioned in relation to these winds would perhaps indicate that it makes more sense to paddle clockwise... or perhaps not. However I have decided that this paddle will be done clockwise! See Fig 1 below:

With the direction of travel figured out, the next step was to estimate the distance. With the help of Garmin HomePort mapping software I got to 282 nautical miles (Fig 2).

Knowing the approximate distance, next step is to see how long this trip might take. With a bit of Excel, one can input the distance, the time of paddling and the break time each hour. The sheet would then spit out a bunch of values indicating in days how long it would take one to paddle a given inputted distance, given certain traveling speeds from 2.5 to 4.5 knots (Fig 3):

From experience, when paddling alone my average pace is 3.5 to 4 kts. Start there, and then as I would get tired the average would drop to perhaps 2.5 kts throughout. To avoid any misinterpretations, the total traveling time as indicated by the table does not imply continuous paddling for that many hours a day. It just states that it would take that calculated number of days to circumnavigate.

> Some considerations below

A. The attached [2023 Canadian Tide and Current tables for the Gulf of St.Lawrence](/chs-shc-tct-tmc-vol2-202301-41085085.pdf), pages 57-58, indicate this year the maximum current speeds at 1.9 knots just lagging a few days the "Buck Moon" (July 5-7). Just avoid this area in this period as there is no need to paddle a strong opposing current.

B. The Charlottetown Harbour, although convenient, it isn't the greatest put-in/take-out spot for this trip as it adds 20 nautical miles (1 extra day), and at the very least one overnight plus the food and water needed. And I know the area very well due to numerous paddles here. While the current is significant in the channel, one can stay closer to the shore. See Fig 4 below:

C. Hazardous area due to high cliffs near Sea Cow Head Lighthouse. The water is deep and we have a long fetch. The SW gets accelerated in the strait and the water builds up quickly. The waves reflect then from the cliffs and we have a chaotic environment. I have been caught unaware once in that spot by a similar built-up. It was not the most pleasant paddle. See Fig 5 below:

D. Cape Egmont Lighthouse. I have not paddled in this spot before but it looks similar to the spot near the Sea Cow Head Lighthouse mentioned above. Hazardous area for sure. See Fig 6 below:

E. Egmont Bay. It is a large bay and potentially one could save a lot of time by paddling deeper into the sea. There is however a long fetch for SW strait accelerated wind, and deep water. The sea could built up fast if wind increases. Staying closer to the shore adds to the distance, however it all depends on the conditions at the time. "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst!" See Fig 7 below:

F. The Campbelton cliffs look like having the potential to create trouble. Will paddle mindfully. Fig 8 below:

Eof.

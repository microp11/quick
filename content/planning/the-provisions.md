Based on the dry-run, for a 10+h day paddle I would need about 3k calories. Adding to that the 2.5k for the average male body, it seems that 5.5k calories a day would be a good guess. The food will be organized in individual 1-day packs.

I should be drinking water and eating/snacking frequently enough and avoid getting light-headed.

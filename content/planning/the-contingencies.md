# DRAFT

> By far the biggest hazard on this trip is paddling alone. This needs special considerations.

And then...

One needs escape routes or areas to get off the water if the conditions deteriorate. One also needs to know where one can land. Many beaches are exposed to open ocean and may have dangerous surf, making landing impossible. What if the wind comes up? What if I need to call for help? Is there cell coverage? Is there radio coverage? Do I need an EPIRB or maybe some bi-directional type of sat link? What if the forecast is incorrect or changes rapidly? What if I need to cut the trip short? The list goes onâ€¦

The last part of contingency planning is completing a float plan. Luckily I know a few fellow kayakers who I would trust this with. I would communicate the plan for the day, what is the starting point and the target. I trust that, if anything, they could analyze the conditions and predict my actions.

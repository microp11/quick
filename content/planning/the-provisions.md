Based on the dry-run, for a 10+h day paddle I would need about 3k calories. Adding to that the 2.5k for the average male body, it seems that 5.5k calories a day would be a good guess. The food will be organized in individual 1-day packs.

Here is one leg from the actual trip to give you an idea of the calorie amount needed per day:

- [Day 10, Cape Egmont to half way West Point and Miminegash](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.suunto.com%2Fmove%2Fpaulmaxan%2F668c62b24675297d58b7ec80&data=05%7C02%7Cpmaxan%40univerus.com%7Cdf19da193af04ca6d48608dca4f9d108%7C6ab2a2ce8e074fc7bc45b8bf2e2e4760%7C0%7C0%7C638566640065558428%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5T2nA6C7xk%2FJTPK2x5OI2ag9rP7FNBRvrNvARSFx3yM%3D&reserved=0)

I would drink and eat/snack frequently enough to avoid getting a headache or light-headed.

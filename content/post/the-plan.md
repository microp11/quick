# DRAFT

> For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating Prince Edward Island in a sea kayak. There are around 300 nautical miles if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.

A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:

-   [William Arthur "Bill" Reddin and dog Bozo (1934-1935), canoe, counter-clockwise](https://islandvoices.ca/islandora/object/ivoices%3A318)
-   [Wendy Killoran (May-June 2005), 15 days, clockwise](https://glska.com/around-p-e-i-by-kayak/)
-   [Joseph Simmonds, teen, sea kayak (August 2016), 12 days, counter-clockwise](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-kayak-1.3729504)
-   [Annette Boerlage, sea kayak, (TODO)](https://fourfeetonadventure.com/)
-   [Douglas Russell and Colin Hudson, SUP (June 2020), 12 days, clockwise](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/two-veterans-become-first-to-paddleboard-around-p-e-i-for-injured-soldiers-1.5978679)

The purpose of the trip is to challenge oneself, enjoy and explore. Speed of travel is secondary to exploring and I have set aside up to a month for doing this trip.

First step was to figure out when to do it. Living in PEI for some time now I figured the months of June and July are the best for a multi-day paddle. The waters start warming up, there are no bugs, it is not excessively warm so no significant weather either, and the daylight time is the longest.

The next step was to see which way to go: clockwise or counter-clockwise. This took some time, discussing with friends and fellow paddlers, and also looking at what other paddlers have done. Around PEI the wind is usually the most important factor, and some currents. The strongest current is in the strait around the Trans-Canada Highway bridge. Picking up neap tides while traversing this area would make the paddling easier.

As a side-note, at the time of writing this, the bridge toll is [$50.25](https://www.confederationbridge.com/tolls-fees) per car.

To get a feel for the winds I went to the [Windy](https://www.windy.com) website and downloaded historical data on the winds around PEI. The prevailing winds during summer are the south-westerlies. The north shore would then be mostly in the lee. The way the island is positioned in report to these winds would perhaps indicate that it makes more sense to paddle clockwise, and perhaps not. This paddle will be done clockwise! See Fig 1 below:

With the direction of travel figured out, the next step was to estimate the distance. With a bit of help of Garmin HomePort mapping software I got to 282 nautical miles (Fig 2).

Knowing the approximate distance, next step is to see how long this trip might take. With a bit of Excel, one can input the distance, the time of paddling and the break time each hour. The sheet would then spit out a bunch of values indicating in days how long it would take one to paddle a given inputted distance, given certain travelling speeds from 2.5 to 4.5 knots (Fig 3):

From experience, when paddling alone my average pace is 3.5 to 4 kts. Start there then and as I would get tired that speed might reach an average of 2.5 kts throughtout. The travelling time does not have to be continuous, however it would take that number of days to circumnavigate.

Starting/finishing point? Avoid extra travel?

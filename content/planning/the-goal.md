> For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating [Prince Edward Island](https://www.google.ca/maps/@46.4033276,-62.9856972,8.32z) in a sea kayak. There are roughly around 300 nautical miles (555 km) if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.

A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:

-   [William Arthur "Bill" Reddin and dog Bozo, canoe (1934-1935), counter-clockwise](https://islandvoices.ca/islandora/object/ivoices%3A318)
-   [Reinhard Zollitsch, sea canoe (1996-2001), 16 days spanning 6 years, clockwise](http://www.zollitschcanoeadventures.com/articles/pei.html)
-   [Wendy Killoran, sea kayak (May-June 2005), 15 days, clockwise](https://glska.com/around-p-e-i-by-kayak/)
-   [Joseph Simmonds, sea kayak (August 2016), 12 days, counter-clockwise](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-kayak-1.3729504)
-   [Annette Boerlage, sea kayak (2014-2016), spanning 3 years, using her bike as a shuttle](https://fourfeetonadventure.com/)
-   [Douglas Russell and Colin Hudson, SUP (June 2020), 12 days, clockwise](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/two-veterans-become-first-to-paddleboard-around-p-e-i-for-injured-soldiers-1.5978679)

The purpose of the trip is to challenge oneself, to enjoy and explore. Speed of travel is secondary to exploring and I have set aside up to a month for doing this trip. This is going to be fun! my first solo multi-day paddle.

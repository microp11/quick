> By far the biggest hazard on this trip is paddling alone and I strongly believe that I am prepared.

In terms of geography, there are areas on this trip where there are high cliffs and it is impossible to land. Due to the positioning of the island in St. Lawrence Bay, there is very little swell on PEI and that greatly increases one's peace of mind regarding unexpected water behaviour. However there are spots where dangerous surf can form that would make landing/launching very difficult or impossible.

There are extensive beaches, dunes and sand bars where in case of an electric storm there is not much hiding available. Luckily there are not many thunderstorms in PEI during the months of June and early July. Squalls could form however anytime.

There are areas with little or no cell coverage. The VHS goes line-of-sight only.

Carry the food for the entire trip and replenish the water along the way.

If for any reason I need to cut the trip short, transportation is arranged.

The **float plan**. Left with someone that knows me and the way I paddle. I trust that, if anything, they could analyze the local conditions and predict my actions.

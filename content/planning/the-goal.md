> For some time now I was pondering on the idea of circumnavigating [Prince Edward Island](https://www.google.ca/maps/@46.4033276,-62.9856972,8.32z) in a sea kayak. There are roughly around 300 nautical miles (555 km) if one is to follow the shore closely, save some if paddling straight lines from one point of a large bay to another.

A few people have done this already, and it is only fair to assume that there are more:

- [William Arthur "Bill" Reddin and dog Bozo, canoe (1934-1935), counter-clockwise](https://islandvoices.ca/islandora/object/ivoices%3A318)
- [Reinhard Zollitsch, sea canoe (1996-2001), 16 days spanning 6 years, clockwise](http://www.zollitschcanoeadventures.com/articles/pei.html)
- [Wendy Killoran, sea kayak (May-June 2005), 15 days, clockwise](https://glska.com/around-p-e-i-by-kayak/)
- [Joseph Simmonds, sea kayak (August 2016), 12 days, counter-clockwise](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-kayak-1.3729504)
- [Annette Boerlage, sea kayak (2014-2016), spanning 3 years, using her bike as a shuttle](https://fourfeetonadventure.com/)
- [Douglas Russell and Colin Hudson, SUP (June 2020), 12 days, clockwise](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/two-veterans-become-first-to-paddleboard-around-p-e-i-for-injured-soldiers-1.5978679)
- [Paul Maxan, sea kayak (2023-2024), 13 days spanning 2 years, clockwise]() (these pages)

The purpose of the trip is to challenge oneself, to enjoy and explore. Speed of travel is secondary to exploring and I have set aside up to a month for doing this trip. This is going to be fun! my first solo multi-day paddle.

> Even the best plans sometime fail. Stop and regroup. I did not complete my circumnavigation in 2023. I have paddled clockwise from North Rustico to Cape Egmont, about 350km. The remaining 200km, from Cape Egmont to North Rustico will be completed this year, 2024.

June 13th 2024, happy to be adding myself to the list of people that have circumnavigated the island.

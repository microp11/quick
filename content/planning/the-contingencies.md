> Rung #3: Contingency Plans

You need escape routes or areas to get off the water if the conditions deteriorate. You also need to know where you can land. Many beaches are exposed to open ocean and may have dangerous surf, making landing impossible. Ask yourself the "what ifs". What if the wind comes up? What if we need to call for help? Is there cell coverage? What if the forecast is incorrect or changes rapidly? What if we need to cut the trip short? The list goes onâ€¦

The last part of contingency planning is completing a float plan. A float plan is a written document describing the route, the group, the timeline and any other information you feel may be relevant. Leave it with someone responsible who can activate a rescue if you do not return as planned. One caution, give yourself lots of time on the float plan to return. You do not want someone initiating a search is you are a couple of hours late or safely under a shelter in safe area waiting for the weather to pass.

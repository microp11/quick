### Trip Planning

> ###### From [C2TC Sea Kayak Coaching](https://committed2thecore.com/) Paddle Canada Level 1 manual.

Have you ever heard the following phrase: "Plan the work, work the plan"? This implies that planning and knowledge determine the outcome of a complex event and that it’s the quality of the planning, not necessarily the execution, that dictates success or failure. The success of any trip is determined before the first dip of the paddle.

Planning for a trip focuses on two broad concepts; enjoyment and controlling hazards. People kayak for pleasure and your goal in trip planning should be to build enjoyment or pleasure and safety into the experience. A ladder is a useful model to represent trip planning. Each rung is a different element that must be completed to reach the goals. If one of the rungs is weak or broken it is more difficult to reach the top or attain success. Your aim in trip planning therefore is to create strong rungs based on experience, sound decision making and information gathering.

The rungs of the "trip planning ladder" are:

> Rung #1: Goal Setting

What do you want to accomplish on this trip? Is this trip a difficult multi-day adventure, or a low key overnight with old friends? Who should come on this trip? Ideally you and your paddling partners should share the same overall goals for the trip. Do they want to challenge themselves in rough conditions or do they want to stay in their comfort zone. Do they have the same skill and knowledge to be an asset on the trip or do they represent a liability? Your safety depends on the skill and attitude of those around you. Perhaps most importantly; are they fun to be around?

> Rung #2: Route Planning

Choose a route that is consistent with your group goals and with the skill level of the group. This is where accurate research is very important. Look at the chart and determine your access and egress points, or possible shelter areas. Consider camping spots and potential rest stops. Consider how much distance you can reasonably cover in the area and potential conditions. You should also consider possible hazards you may face in the paddling area. Always give yourself lots of time to account for any variables that may impact the journey.

> Rung #3: Contingency Plans

You need escape routes or areas to get off the water if the conditions deteriorate. You also need to know where you can land. Many beaches are exposed to open ocean and may have dangerous surf, making landing impossible. Ask yourself the ‘what ifs’. What if the wind comes up? What if we need to call for help? Is there cell coverage? What if the forecast is incorrect or changes rapidly? What if we need to cut the trip short? The list goes on…

The last part of contingency planning is completing a float plan. A float plan is a written document describing the route, the group, the timeline and any other information you feel may be relevant. Leave it with someone responsible who can activate a rescue if you do not return as planned. One caution, give yourself lots of time on the float plan to return. You do not want someone initiating a search is you are a couple of hours late or safely under a shelter in safe area waiting for the weather to pass.

> Rung #4: Ration and Equipment Planning

When determining what food to take, be careful to select foods that travel well and food that you actually like! Take lots of water and drink often because dehydration is a contributing factor to hypothermia. A bit of extra food is also a good idea in case you are delayed by a day due to weather. Equipment is just one element needed to control hazards and resolve situations. Ensuring you have the proper clothing and equipment will contribute to a safe and enjoyable adventure. Again consider the ‘what ifs’. What if someone capsizes? Do we have enough warm clothes and equipment to deal with the situation? What if someone requires a tow? What if someone is has gets injured? What if a paddle is broken? There any many things to consider in terms of equipment and food planning.

> Rung #5 Reflection

Good Judgment, a combination of experience and reflection is something every paddler should strive for. Paddling a lot is not enough. We should reflect on the successes and challenges faced during each trip and use these lessons in future trip plans. What did you do well? What could have been done better? Also consider some reflection as a group. Following up on the trip with each other to share photos or just to discuss the trip over dinner is an important part of the reflection process.

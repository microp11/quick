Mid January I have received the long awaited [Xeon](https://www.kayakpro.com/xeon/) ergometer. I am amazed! Even the blisters that I get from using it are in the same spots as where I usually get them while paddling a real kayak.

I started to map the session on the ergo with the distances and the PEI map. Hopefully will give me a clear idea of how this plan is going to work. This of course if not very realistic as conditions are not being considered. But it could be fun to see.
